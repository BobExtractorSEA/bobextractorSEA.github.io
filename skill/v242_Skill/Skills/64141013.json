  "Name": "Chain Arts: Takedown VI",
  "Job": "Cadena",
  "Desc": "Quickly draws a long chain and swings it around to chain enemies within range. Chain Arts: Takedown chains the enemy with the highest Max HP first.<br />After chaining, Pommels the enemy with such speed that it leaves afterimages. The power of the Pommel depends on the number of additional Weapon Variation attacks activated during that time, and Weapon Variation stacks are maximized during the Pommel.<br />Not affected by Cooldown Reset effects. Attacked enemies resist Bind for 90 sec., becoming immune to Bind by Chain Arts: Takedown and other skills.<br />Required Skill: <span style=\"font-weight:bold; color:orange;\">Chain Arts: Takedown Lv. 30 or higher</span>",

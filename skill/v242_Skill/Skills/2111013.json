Deadly poison is continuously generated from the pentacle, so the Poison zone gradually spreads to the right and left directions. The deadly poison zone doesn't spread anymore when it reaches the end of the platform.<br />The deadly poison of this zone is flammable. If you use Fire magic on the deadly poison zone, or this zone is hit by Fire magic within a certain period of time after the poison is generated, a powerful explosion occurs in the zone. The explosion may even detonate the surrounding Poison zones as well. This is a kind of Poison Element attack.",

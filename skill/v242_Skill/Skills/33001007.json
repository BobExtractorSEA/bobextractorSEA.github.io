  "Desc": "Summons Jaguars to fight together. The Jaguars attack your target first. You can command them to use <span style=\"font-weight:bold; color:orange;\">[Jaguar skills]</span>. The <span style=\"font-weight:bold; color:orange;\">Jaguar skills target the Boss monster with the highest Max HP within range before everyone else</span>. If there's no Boss monster, then Jaguars attack in your facing direction.<br />While Jaguars are summoned, use this skill again with the Down key to keep the main Jaguar in place while fighting.<br />The fixed Jaguar attacks a Boss monster with the highest Max HP within range first and moves back to your location if it becomes too far away from you.<br />Use Jaguar Rider to ride a Jaguar.",
